# CNN resolution degrader

Simple neural network for downscaling aerial images.
Trained on real high and low resolution photos taken by different cameras.
Created as a preliminary step in making a system for data augmentation for
super-resolution imaging.

# DVC flow

Dvc tracks models with dvc in name. If you want to run things independent of
it, just call the scripts and pass any other name as parameter.
